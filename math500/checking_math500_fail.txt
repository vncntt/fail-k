CORRECT ANSWER: \left( 3, \frac{\pi}{2} \right)
MODEL OUTPUT: (3, π/2)
COMPARISON ANSWER : TRUE
These are equivalent expressions. The second one just uses LaTeX notation (\left and \right for parentheses, and \frac for the fraction), but they represent the same ordered pair of numbers: 3 and π/2.

<ANSWER>YES</ANSWER>
CORRECT ANSWER: \left( 3, \frac{\pi}{2} \right)
MODEL OUTPUT: (3,π/2)
COMPARISON ANSWER : TRUE
These are the same mathematical expression, just written in different formats. 
The first uses regular text notation π/2, while the second uses LaTeX notation \frac{\pi}{2}.
Both represent the point with x-coordinate 3 and y-coordinate π/2.

<ANSWER>YES</ANSWER>
CORRECT ANSWER: \left( 3, \frac{\pi}{2} \right)
MODEL OUTPUT: (3,π/2)
COMPARISON ANSWER : TRUE
These answers are equivalent. (3,π/2) and \left( 3, \frac{\pi}{2} \right) are just different ways of writing the same ordered pair. The first is a simpler notation, while the second uses \left and \right for parentheses and the fraction notation for π/2, but they represent the same point.

<ANSWER>YES</ANSWER>
CORRECT ANSWER: \left( 3, \frac{\pi}{2} \right)
MODEL OUTPUT: (3,1.5708)
COMPARISON ANSWER : TRUE
These answers are equivalent since 1.5708 radians is approximately equal to π/2 (≈ 1.5708). The first coordinate is identical in both (3), and 1.5708 is just the decimal representation of π/2.

<ANSWER>YES</ANSWER>
CORRECT ANSWER: p - q
MODEL OUTPUT: p - q
COMPARISON ANSWER : TRUE
These expressions are identical:
p - q and p - q

MODEL OUTPUT: p - q
COMPARISON ANSWER : TRUE
These expressions are identical: p - q = p - q

<ANSWER>YES</ANSWER>
CORRECT ANSWER: p - q
MODEL OUTPUT: p-q
COMPARISON ANSWER : TRUE
These expressions are equivalent. They represent the same mathematical operation of subtracting q from p. The only difference is spacing, which doesn't affect the mathematical meaning.

<ANSWER>YES</ANSWER>
CORRECT ANSWER: p - q
MODEL OUTPUT: p-q
COMPARISON ANSWER : TRUE
These expressions are equivalent. They're the same mathematical expression, just written with different spacing. Both represent subtraction of q from p.

<ANSWER>YES</ANSWER>
CORRECT ANSWER: \frac{14}{3}

These expressions are equivalent. \frac{14}{3} is just the LaTeX/mathematical notation for writing fractions, while 14/3 is the plain text way of writing the same fraction.

<ANSWER>YES</ANSWER>
CORRECT ANSWER: \frac{14}{3}
MODEL OUTPUT: 14/3
COMPARISON ANSWER : TRUE
These are the same value. 14/3 and \frac{14}{3} are just different ways of writing the same fraction - the second one using LaTeX notation to display it in a more traditional vertical fraction format.
