CORRECT ANSWER: \left( 3, \frac{\pi}{2} \right)
MODEL OUTPUT: (3,π/2)
COMPARISON ANSWER : TRUE
These are equivalent. The second answer just uses LaTeX notation to write the exact same point: (3, π/2)

<ANSWER>YES</ANSWER>
CORRECT ANSWER: p - q
MODEL OUTPUT: p - q
COMPARISON ANSWER : TRUE
These expressions are identical.

<ANSWER>YES</ANSWER>
CORRECT ANSWER: \frac{14}{3}
MODEL OUTPUT: 14/3
COMPARISON ANSWER : TRUE
These expressions are equivalent. 14/3 and \frac{14}{3} are just different ways of writing the same fraction. The \frac{14}{3} is just the LaTeX notation for writing a fraction, while 14/3 is a more plain text way of writing it.

<ANSWER>YES</ANSWER>
CORRECT ANSWER: 9
MODEL OUTPUT: 9
COMPARISON ANSWER : TRUE
These answers are exactly the same.

<ANSWER>YES</ANSWER>
CORRECT ANSWER: \text{Evelyn}
MODEL OUTPUT: Evelyn
COMPARISON ANSWER : TRUE
These answers are equivalent. \text{Evelyn} is just the LaTeX/mathematical notation way of writing Evelyn as plain text, but they represent the same thing.
<ANSWER>YES</ANSWER>
CORRECT ANSWER: 42
MODEL OUTPUT: 42
COMPARISON ANSWER : TRUE
These are the exact same number: 42=42

<ANSWER>YES</ANSWER>
CORRECT ANSWER: 27
MODEL OUTPUT: 27
COMPARISON ANSWER : TRUE
These answers are exactly the same number (27).

<ANSWER>YES</ANSWER>
CORRECT ANSWER: 90^\circ
MODEL OUTPUT: 72
COMPARISON ANSWER : FALSE
These are not equivalent.

72 is just a number, while 90° represents an angle of 90 degrees. 

72 ≠ 90 degrees

<ANSWER>NO</ANSWER>
CORRECT ANSWER: 3\sqrt{13}
MODEL OUTPUT: 3√13
COMPARISON ANSWER : TRUE
These are equivalent. Both represent the same mathematical expression - 3 times the square root of 13. The second one just uses LaTeX notation (\sqrt) while the first uses the √ symbol directly.

<ANSWER>YES</ANSWER>
CORRECT ANSWER: 4
MODEL OUTPUT: 2
COMPARISON ANSWER : FALSE
These answers (2 and 4) are clearly not equivalent as they are different numbers.

<ANSWER>NO</ANSWER>
CORRECT ANSWER: 2220
MODEL OUTPUT: 2220
COMPARISON ANSWER : TRUE
Looking at both answers:

2220 = 2220

They are exactly the same number.

<ANSWER>YES</ANSWER>
CORRECT ANSWER: \frac{3}{56}
MODEL OUTPUT: 8/63
COMPARISON ANSWER : FALSE
Converting both to decimals for quick comparison:

8/63 ≈ 0.127
3/56 ≈ 0.054

These are clearly not equivalent.

<ANSWER>NO</ANSWER>
CORRECT ANSWER: 284
MODEL OUTPUT: 284
COMPARISON ANSWER : TRUE
The answers 284 and 284 are identical numbers.

<ANSWER>YES</ANSWER>
CORRECT ANSWER: 5
MODEL OUTPUT: 5
COMPARISON ANSWER : TRUE
These answers are clearly equivalent as they are both exactly 5.

<ANSWER>YES</ANSWER>
CORRECT ANSWER: \sqrt{51}
MODEL OUTPUT: √51
COMPARISON ANSWER : TRUE
These expressions are exactly the same - √51 and \sqrt{51} are just different ways of writing the square root of 51. The first uses the radical symbol √, while the second uses the LaTeX notation \sqrt{}, but they represent the identical mathematical expression.

<ANSWER>YES</ANSWER>
CORRECT ANSWER: 6 - 5i
MODEL OUTPUT: 6 - 5i
COMPARISON ANSWER : TRUE
These expressions are identical:
6 - 5i = 6 - 5i

<ANSWER>YES</ANSWER>
CORRECT ANSWER: -50
MODEL OUTPUT: -50
COMPARISON ANSWER : TRUE
These answers are identical (-50 = -50).

<ANSWER>YES</ANSWER>
CORRECT ANSWER: \pi
MODEL OUTPUT: π
COMPARISON ANSWER : TRUE
These answers are equivalent. \pi is just the LaTeX notation for π. They represent the same mathematical constant.

<ANSWER>YES</ANSWER>
CORRECT ANSWER: 28
MODEL OUTPUT: 56
COMPARISON ANSWER : FALSE
These answers are not equivalent.
56 is twice as large as 28.

<ANSWER>NO</ANSWER>
CORRECT ANSWER: 3
MODEL OUTPUT: 3+2√2
COMPARISON ANSWER : FALSE
The answers are not equivalent.
3+2√2 is larger than 3 because it includes the additional term 2√2, which is approximately 2.828.
3+2√2 ≈ 5.828, while 3 is just 3.

<ANSWER>NO</ANSWER>
CORRECT ANSWER: 6+9i
MODEL OUTPUT: 6 + 9i
COMPARISON ANSWER : TRUE
These answers are equivalent. They're exactly the same expression, just written with different spacing.

<ANSWER>YES</ANSWER>
CORRECT ANSWER: 13535
MODEL OUTPUT: 15624
COMPARISON ANSWER : FALSE
These numbers are clearly different:
15624 ≠ 13535

<ANSWER>NO</ANSWER>
CORRECT ANSWER: 5
MODEL OUTPUT: 5
COMPARISON ANSWER : TRUE
These answers are the same number (5).

<ANSWER>YES</ANSWER>
CORRECT ANSWER: x=5
MODEL OUTPUT: 5
COMPARISON ANSWER : TRUE
These answers are equivalent. While the second one explicitly writes it as x=5 and the first just states 5, they're expressing the same value/solution.

<ANSWER>YES</ANSWER>
CORRECT ANSWER: 10
MODEL OUTPUT: 10
COMPARISON ANSWER : TRUE
These answers are identical.

<ANSWER>YES</ANSWER>
CORRECT ANSWER: 1,-2
MODEL OUTPUT: 1
COMPARISON ANSWER : FALSE
These answers are not equivalent.

The first answer gives only one solution (1), while the second answer provides two solutions (1 and -2).

These represent different sets of solutions to whatever equation or problem they came from.

<ANSWER>NO</ANSWER>
CORRECT ANSWER: 144
MODEL OUTPUT: 384
COMPARISON ANSWER : FALSE
These numbers are clearly different:
384 ≠ 144

<ANSWER>NO</ANSWER>
CORRECT ANSWER: 78
MODEL OUTPUT: 78
COMPARISON ANSWER : TRUE
These answers are exactly the same.

<ANSWER>YES</ANSWER>
CORRECT ANSWER: -2 + 7i
MODEL OUTPUT: -2 + 7i
COMPARISON ANSWER : TRUE
These are identical expressions, both showing a complex number with a real part of -2 and an imaginary part of 7i.

<ANSWER>YES</ANSWER>
CORRECT ANSWER: 225
MODEL OUTPUT: 225
COMPARISON ANSWER : TRUE
These answers are identical - both are 225.

<ANSWER>YES</ANSWER>
