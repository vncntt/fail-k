    "# Fail@k Evaluation Framework\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook implements a framework for evaluating language models using both standard accuracy metrics and the fail@k metric.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is fail@k?\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike pass@k (which counts a question as correct if any of k attempts succeeds), fail@k only counts a question as correct if ALL k attempts are correct. This is a much stricter test of model reliability.\n",
    "\n",
    "- pass@k tests the upper bound of model potential\n",
    "- fail@k tests the lower bound of model reliability\n",
    "\n",
    "As noted in the planning document, if a model is 95% reliable, you still have to check every output. But if it's 99.5% reliable, you might fully trust the model without manual verification.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Features\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Organized directory structure**: All results are stored in a structured way by dataset and evaluation type\n",
    "- **Standardized metrics**: Both regular accuracy and fail@k are implemented consistently\n",
    "- **Metadata tracking**: Each run is tracked with timestamps and detailed results\n",
    "- **Visualization tools**: Built-in functions to visualize and compare results\n",
    "- **Async option**: Both synchronous and asynchronous evaluation modes\n",
    "- **Multi-model comparison**: Easily compare multiple models on the same dataset\n",
    "- **Full experiment automation**: Run comprehensive experiments with a single function call\n",
    "\n",
    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "To run an experiment, first ensure your environment variables are set up correctly (particularly `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`), then use:\n",
    "1. The individual test functions (`run_accuracy_test`, `run_fail_at_k_test`) for specific experiments\n",
    "2. Visualization functions (`visualize_results`, `compare_models`) to analyze results\n",
    "3. The `run_full_experiment` function to run a complete battery of tests"
